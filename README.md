# Capsian-Engine
Capsian is a weird, incomplete and performant Python game engine.
It was initially called "KeyFire Engine" but it was later renaemd to apsian due to trademark related issues.

# Performacne
Capsian's performance are pretty great. All though written in Python, the engine's performance ae good at worst and amazing at best.
While testing, the highest framerate recorded was 169000 FPS, to make clear just how much this is, if you rendered exactly 60 frames per second, it would take you 46 minutes to ssee a simular amount of frames.
There are ares of the engine, such as 2D, that could be improved both in feature and in performance, but overall you are not gonna have big performance problems. 

ALL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON A GTX 1080 AND INTEL CORE i7 8700K 3.70GHz

# Languages
Casian mostly uses Python, all though a custom language is available for scripting. You can enable it in the options.cpsn file. It's called tzylang and it probably will be removed in the following updates. It is not raccomended for this very reason: your code may not be runnable in later versions of the engine.
