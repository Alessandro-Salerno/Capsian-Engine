**Bug fixes**
- Having a label would cause problems when closing a Window (FIXED)
- GUI and GAME scenes would merge together. This would allow all your GUI to be rendered in 3D space as well (Fixed)
- Inconsistent behaviour of fullscreen windows on multi-monitor setups. The Window will now always open on the x0 y0 monitor - your main monitor
